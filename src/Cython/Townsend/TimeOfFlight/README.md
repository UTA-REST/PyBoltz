# TOF - Time of flight
This directory has the TOF.pyx. This file takes the output values in the TPlanes arraies. Those values are simulated by the Monte/MONTEFDT.pyx file.
From the time, energy, velocity and count of the electrons at each of the 7 time planes it outputs values such as the Towensend coeffiecients, velocity, and diffusion.
