# Townsend simulation
This directory contains all the necessary modules needed to run the Steady state (SST) and time of flight simulation (TOF) to calculate the Townsend coeffiecients. The main file in this directory is the ALPCALCT.pyx, this file facilitates the simulations. It starts out by estimating a good starting value for the coeffiecients and then it runs both the SST and TOF Monte carlo functions.
